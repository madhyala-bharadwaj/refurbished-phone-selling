# PhoneDash: Refurbished Phone Inventory Management System

## 1. Overview

**PhoneDash** is a robust, full-stack web application designed to manage and simulate the selling of refurbished phones across multiple e-commerce platforms (X, Y, and Z). It provides a professional, feature-rich dashboard for handling complex inventory, platform-specific pricing, and condition categorization.

This project was built to solve key challenges in the refurbished electronics market, such as preventing unprofitable listings due to high fees, managing stock levels accurately, and translating internal product conditions to platform-specific standards.

## 2. Key Features

* **üìä Interactive Analytics Dashboard:** Get a real-time overview of your inventory with charts for stock distribution by brand and condition, and KPIs for total inventory value.
* **üì¶ Comprehensive Inventory Management:** Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for your phone stock.
* **üìë Bulk Data Management:** Effortlessly add hundreds of phones at once using the CSV bulk upload feature.
* **üîç Advanced Search & Filtering:** Instantly filter the entire inventory by brand, condition, or platform. The dashboard analytics dynamically update to reflect your filters.
* **‚öôÔ∏è Platform-Specific Logic:**
    * **Automated Pricing:** Prices are automatically calculated for each platform based on their unique fee structures (e.g., X: 10% fee, Y: 8% + $2).
    * **Condition Mapping:** Internal conditions (e.g., "Excellent") are automatically translated to platform-specific categories (e.g., "3 stars (Excellent)").
    * **Profitability Checks:** The system prevents listing phones that would be unprofitable due to high platform fees.
* **üñ±Ô∏è Efficient Bulk Actions:** List all filtered phones onto a specific platform with a single click.
* **üìù Action Audit Log:** A running log of all significant actions (create, update, delete, list) for full traceability.
* **üîê Secure by Design:** The backend features mock authentication to protect sensitive endpoints and uses Pydantic for rigorous data validation.

## 3. Technology Stack

This application is built with a modern, professional technology stack chosen for performance, scalability, and maintainability.

* **Backend:** **Python 3.11+** with the **FastAPI** framework for its high performance and automatic API documentation.
* **Frontend:** Vanilla **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **JavaScript (ES6+)** with **Tailwind CSS** for rapid, professional UI development.
* **Data Visualization:** **Chart.js** for creating interactive and responsive dashboard charts.
* **Data Handling:** **Pandas** for robust and efficient CSV parsing.
* **Server:** **Uvicorn** server.

## 4. Professional Architecture

The project is built on a modular, decoupled architecture that separates concerns, making it highly maintainable and scalable.

* **Backend (Python/FastAPI):**
    * **`main.py`:** API router and entry point.
    * **`services.py`:** Contains all core business logic, acting as an intermediary between the API and the database.
    * **`models.py`:** Pydantic models for strict data validation and schema definition.
    * **`utils.py`:** Helper functions for isolated tasks like price calculation and condition mapping.
    * **`database.py`:** Abstracted data persistence layer (currently JSON, easily swappable for a SQL/NoSQL database).
    * **`security.py`:** Handles authentication logic.
* **Frontend (JavaScript):**
    * **Multi-Page Application (MPA):** A dedicated `login.html` page ensures a robust separation between authentication and the main application (`app.html`).
    * **Modular JS:** The `main.js` file is structured with clear modules for API communication, UI rendering, and state management.
